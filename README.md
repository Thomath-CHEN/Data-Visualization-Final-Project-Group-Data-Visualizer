# Data-Visualization-Final-Project-Group-Data-Visualizers


## Description
This repository contains files for our final projects of Data Visualization course at CentraleSupelec. The topic of our project is worldwide CO2 Emission inspection.

## Files
The main.py is the main streamlit script that will be run to display webpages. The "source files" folders contain python codes of data preprocessing, including those for training the random forest model and for generating world maps. You can find images and icons as well as our source data in "webpage files" files.

## Usage
Download the codes and support files at folder "webpage files". Modify the "path" variable in main.py so that you can load the data and models. Open your terminal (such as Anaconda3 Prompt) and cd to the directory which the main.py is located. Then enter: streamlit run main.py to view our magic interactive visaulization apps.
